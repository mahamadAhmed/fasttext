# FastText Model Training and Pretrained FastText Usage
This repository contains code for training a FastText model on Yelp dataset tips and using a pretrained FastText model provided by Facebook.

### Overview
The code in this repository demonstrates the following:

Data Import: The code fetches data from the Yelp dataset using Kaggle's data import utilities.
Text Preprocessing: Text data from the Yelp dataset tips is preprocessed using techniques such as tokenization, lemmatization, and stopword removal.
FastText Model Training: A FastText model is trained on the preprocessed text data.
Word Similarity Analysis: The trained FastText model is utilized to find similar and dissimilar words for a given set of random words.
Pretrained FastText Model Usage: The code also showcases how to use a pretrained FastText model provided by Facebook for word similarity analysis.
